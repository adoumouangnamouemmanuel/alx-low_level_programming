<h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">C PROGRAMMING 0x00. C - Hello, World</h1>
<h3>Note: When doing this project, After using text editor of your choice to create and access the file on insert mode.Ensure the first line is always having #!/bin/bash, then the second line is having the correct command/answer.</h3>
<p>(From your terminal, convert the file created to <strong>SCRIPT</strong> i.e: chmod u+x filename)</p>
<p>This project is the first C project as part of the alx_africa curriculum, and covers the very basics of compilation and C.</p>

<ul> <li>File> 0-preprocessor: is a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.</li></ul>
<h3>input: <span style="background-color: #666;">gcc -E $CFILE -o c</span></h3>
<h2>1. Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.</h2>
<ul><li>File> 1-compiler: is a script that compiles a C file but does not link.</li></ul>

<ul><li>File> 5-printf.c: is a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.</li></ul>
<h3>input: check inside the file <span style="background-color: #666;">5-printf.c</span> to see code.</h3>
<h2>6. Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.</h2>
<ul><li>File> 6-size.c: is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.</li></ul>
<h3>input: check inside the file <span style="background-color: #666;">6-size.c</span> to see code.</h3>
