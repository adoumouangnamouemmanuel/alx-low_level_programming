<h1>Project on 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while</h1>
<p>In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type <strong>char</strong>, <strong>int</strong>, and <strong>unsigned int</strong>, using <strong>if</strong> and <strong>else...if</strong> statements, and implementing <strong>while loops</strong>.</p>
<h1>Tasks</h1>
<ul>

<li><h3>0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing</h3></li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adoumouangnamouemmanuel/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c">0-positive_or_negative.c</a>: C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line:</li>
<ul>
<li>Completion of <a href="https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c">this source code.</li>
<li>Stores a different random number every time the program is run.</li>
<li>Prints the number followed by is positive if the number is greater than 0, is zero if the number is zero, or is negative if the number is less than 0.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li><h3>1. The last digit</h3></li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adoumouangnamouemmanuel/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c">1-last_digit.c</a>: C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line:</li>
<ul>
<li>Completion of <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c">this source code.</li>
<li>Stores a different random number every time the program is run.</li>
<li>Prints the string Last digit of [number] is [last_digit] and is followed by greater than 5 if the digit is greater than 5, 0 if the digit is 0, or less than 6 and not 0 if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
